    title: 'Filter bubble',
    shortText: `There is no freedom on the Internet. And not everyone knows about it.`,
    text1: `  There is no freedom on the Internet. And not everyone knows about it. Today, the main trend of the global online space is that the audience is increasingly segmented and information is filtered. We think we can see or find everything, but in reality we don't.
            Internet users have long been limited only by their own interests and are inside the so-called «filter bubble». This term was coined by internet activist Eli Pariser and described in his book of the same name. According to the author a «filter bubble» -  is a state of intellectual isolation that can result from personalized searches, where a website algorithm selectively guesses what information a user would like to see based on information about the user, such as location, past click-behavior and search history. As a result, users become separated from information that disagrees with their viewpoints, effectively isolating them in own cultural or ideological bubbles. [1] Also, to illustrate the principle of the filter bubble, Mark Zuckerberg's phrase is often quoted: «A squirrel dying in your front yard may be more relevant to your interests right now than people dying in Africa». [2] Thus, the main disadvantage of personalized search is that you do not decide what information to get gets displayed on certain searches on the Internet most internet search searvices. The internet Algorithms decide for you what you get to see. More importantly, you won't even see information about what's left behind outside the «filter bubble».
           To understand how the «filter bubble» works, I suggest you conduct a simple experiment. Ask any of your relatives or friends on their personal computers or smartphones to write the similar queries for the same search engine (who dont use our service). Surely the search results will be different. This is an example of how a bubble filter works.`,
    text2: `It must also be understood that online media providers, such as Google or Facebook, compete for user attention. The goal is to maximize the time users spend on their respective sites, in order to maximize profits generated through advertising [3]. For this they need to collect a lot of data about you.
            As former Google CEO Eric Schmidt said: «It will be very hard for people to watch or consume something, that has not in some sense been tailored for them» [4]. This means that standard «Google» no longer exists. Most internet companies fit search results to our individual tastes and weed out «extra» or possibly unwanted information. Therefore, by depriving ourselves of this «extra» information, we stop thinking critically, we become intellectually isolated in our own «filter bubble».
            We almost never receive information that contradicts our point of view. It is clear that each of us tends to trust information that corresponds to our point of view. But in reality, our point of view may not always be right. Eventually this could lead to the following dystopia: «One day you wake up and you find that everyone agrees with what you think» [5]. `,
    text3: `The filter bubble prevents us from seeing the world from different perspectives. The scope of our thinking is shrinking. A person who perceives the world through the prism of his electronic devices some online services does not notice how reality is possibly being for example replaced by fabricated images of the mass media industry or advertising. Thus, the filter bubble can be a tool of public influence and control. The lack of critical thinking along with the effect of “lazy audience” becomes a fertile field for the use of various techniques for manipulating attention and spreading false information on the web. Web system can be used bubble filter for global purposes to form the right points of view. For example, a user has two friends in a social network: one of them makes posts with the support of for  the president, and the other with his criticism. If the user likes the first friend and ignores the second, then gradually more and more posts with a high assessment of the president will appear in his feed. According to the book «Are Filter Bubbles Real?» by Axel Bruns, the focus on filter bubbles may be preventing us from properly confronting the deeper causes of division in both politics and society [6]. The influence of the filter bubble makes people more vulnerable to propaganda and manipulation, and globally slows down democratic processes around the world. In an article published in Wired magazine it is written, that filter bubbles are destroying democracy [7].
            The filter bubble works today not only for such giants as Google or Facebook. Many companies around the world are also using personalization.
            So, how to broaden your horizons? - There is no universal recipe. But the first step towards development is the realization that such a trend has already taken root in the life of every Internet user. Technically, there are a few simple techniques you can use to avoid personalizing information on the Internet: 
            
            Delete all cookies, they need to be cleared periodically;
            Delete your web browsing history;
            Hide your personal data on Facebook and other social networks. Use nicknames whenever possible;
            Turn off targeted ads;
            Use incognito mode in your browser - it will save you from cookies, and therefore it will be possible to see almost depersonalized information;
            Depersonalize your browser. [1]
            
            It is necessary to go beyond the bubble of filters, developing your intelligence and critical thinking. We always need to dig deeper. The most effective system of Internet control is not the one that has the most sophisticated and draconian system of censorship, but the one that has no need for censorship whatsoeve [8]. So, we need to overcome not censorship, but the filter bubble. Cause we can see more than what is shown to us.`,

    title: 'Data breach',
    shortText: `The networkdigital revoltion has long penetrated deeply into our lives. `,
    text1: ` The networkdigital revoltion has long penetrated deeply into our lives. From shopping, to reading the latest news to paying bills – Nowadays almost anything can be done online. However, this convenience comes at a price and sometimes this price can be very high. Today, malicious attackers can access your personal data comfortably from their couch. Therefore, our personal information is at risk every day, because our data can be mired in a breach.
            But what is a data breach? How do we define it? According to the «good and old» Wikipedia a data breach is a security violation, in which sensitive, protected or confidential data is copied, transmitted, viewed, stolen or used by an individual or organisation unauthorized to do so [1] - in simple words, this is the theft of our personal confidential information. There have been more and more data breaches in recent years. The target of hackings is often government agency data, banks, our personally identifiable information, intellectual property or corporate data. Both large organization and small companies could suffer from data breach.This contributes to the fact that people stop trusting any organizations. 
            Let's look at the main causes of data breach: `,
    text2: `Stolen/Weak Credentials
            Password cracking is an attack in which hackers try to hack or determine a password. Password hacking uses a variety of programmatic techniques and automation using specialized tools. Password guessing is also a really simple way leads to hacking. Using weak or predictable passwords always puts your data at risk. This way is often the easiest for experienced cybercriminals.
            Phishing
            Phishing - is a type of attack in which an attacker masquerades as a reputable organization, such as a bank or tax department, to distribute probabilistic links in order to get potential victims to hand over valuable information, such as a password, credit card details, intellectual property and so on. Clicking on such a link can compromise all data in the system.
            Malware
            Cyber criminals can use malware for any number of purposes. Viruses can be sent to people with the goal of wiping their computer. This can be very harmful to any company, especially those who rely on their data.In order to prevent these types of viruses, don’t click on anything you aren’t sure where it is from. Using a pirated or outdated software/browser also can put you a notch higher on the target list of hackers.
            Ransomware
            Ransomware - is a type of attack that threatens to publish the victim's personal data or perpetually block access to it unless a ransom is paid. Ransomware has quickly become the most prominent and visible type of malware.
            Human error
            Data breach due to human error includes instances such as sending an email to the wrong recipient, loss of paperwork or responding to a request by disclosing some confidential information by mistake. 
            Distributed Denial-of-Service (DDoS)`,
    text3: `            This attack is typically only done to larger companies and is often a form of protest. 
            In this type of attack it is not possible to log in. However, data is not necessarily lost.
            The decentralized international activist and hacktivist collective «Anonymous»  is most widely known for its DDoS attacks against governments, government-affiliated groups, corporations, financial institutions all over the world and go on.
            Every year, the causes of data breach change. Some of them are stop working, others becoming more common. According to the «2022 Data Breach Investigation Report» [2]:
            25% of the thousands of data breaches analyzed were ransomware attacks. Also, ransomware attacks increased 13%, a rise as big as the past five years combined.
            Supply chain was responsible for 62% of System Intrusion incidents. 
            Human errors were responsible for 13% of data breaches.
            82% of breaches involved the human element. Whether it is the Use of stolen credentials, Phishing, Misuse, or simply an Error, people continue to play a very large role in incidents and breaches alike.
            Also, breaches due to system intrusion have ratcheted up dramatically since 2019, according to Verizon’s «2022 Data Breach Investigations Report». While system intrusion, which includes hacking, malware, and ransomware, was the most common type of data breach in 2021, it didn’t even make the top three in 2019.
            By the way, according to a report from Motherboard [3], Verizon also had experienced a data breach, when the full names, email addresses, corporate ID numbers, and phone numbers of company’s employees were compromised. According to the hacker, the information was obtained when he was able to convince a Verizon employee to give him remote access to their corporate terminal.Apparently, this was an easy task, as the hacker simply posed as an internal support employee. The hacker also stated that they had contacted Verizon, requesting a payment of $250,000 USD in order to keep the information contained. Verizon has confirmed the data breach, but the company has said it will not engage with the hacker because they don’t believe the information is sensitive.
            Actually any data breach is dangerous, even if it's not passwords or credit card information. Minimal personal data can be used to impersonate others, harass people in the dataset, or to conduct phishing scams. 
            Let's take a look at some of the biggest data breaches in history: 
            Yahoo (2013)
            3 billion records were affected: real names, email addresses, dates of birth, telephone numbers, and security questions. The damage was $350 million estimated loss in value of company. 
            First American Financial Corporation data breach (2019)
            885 million records were affected: bank account numbers, bank statements, mortgage and tax records, social security numbers, wire transaction receipts, and driver license images. This data breach was unique in the sense that there was not a breach in the company's servers, but an authentication error, meaning no authentication was required to view documents. 
            Facebook data breach (2019)
            540 million records were affected: phone numbers, user names, genders, and locations. 
            Multiple Facebook databases were found to be unprotected by passwords or encryption, meaning anyone who searched the internet could find them.
            Marriott International data breach (2018)
            500 million records were affected: some combination of contact information, passport number, Starwood Preferred Guest numbers, travel information, credit card numbers and expiration dates, other personal information. Damages amounted to a fine of about $24 million.
            Adult FriendFinder Networks data breach (2016)
            412.2 million records were affected: names, email addresses and passwords. 
            Confidential account information was leaked. The stolen data came from six databases with 20 years of information.
            MySpace data breach (2013)
            360 million records were affected: email addresses, usernames, and passwords for some but not all affected accounts. The attack was carried out by a russian hacker. The stolen accounts were leaked to LeakedSources and also available to purchase on the Dark Web market The Real Deal for 6 Bitcoin.
            Equifax data breach (2017)
            148 million records were affected: social Security numbers, birthdates, addresses, driver's license numbers and credit card information. Total damage consisted of $700 million and also a major reputational loss. 
            According to the «Irish Council for Civil Liberties» (ICCL) report [4] the biggest data breach occur in online advertising’s Real-Time Bidding (RTB) system, hundreds of billions of times daily. Literally right now.
            Real-Time Bidding (RTB) operates behind the scenes on websites and apps. It tracks what you are looking at, no matter how private or sensitive, and it records where you go. Every day it broadcasts this data about you to a host of companies continuously, enabling them to profile you. «RTB is the biggest data breach ever recorded. It tracks and shares what people view online and their real-world location 294 billion times in the U.S. and 197 billion times in Europe every day. On average, a person in the U.S. has their online activity and location exposed 747 times every day by the RTB industry. In Europe, RTB exposes people’s data 376 times a day. Europeans and U.S. Internet users’ private data is sent to firms across the globe, including to Russia and China, without any means of controlling. The biggest RTB companies include Google and Microsoft» - wrote the researchers.
            Data breach are becoming more sophisticated with every passing day. For example, each of us has ever used the services of food delivery. It's so convenient when you don’t want to leave the house, but you really want pizza. It would seem, what is the connection between a simple pizza and data breach? - Direct connection. In March 2022, a data breach occurred in a Russian food delivery service[5]. The network leaked the names and surnames of customers, phone numbers, the full delivery address of the customer, and even comments on their orders.
            So, the private things you do and watch online are collected from a vast system that operates virtually every website and app. This allows hackers to collate all of your data – including your sexuality, your medical conditions, your location and even food preferences.
            The number of data hacks is growing every year. In 2021, a new record was set with more than 5.9 billion user records stolen [6]. But According to a new report from Kaspersky [7], the frequency of cyberattacks in 2022 has already increased by almost 3 million. Researchers compared the period between January and April 2022 to the same period in 2021, finding increases in the numbers of Trojan-PSW detections, internet attacks and attacks on Remote Desktop Protocol. Trojan-PSW is a malware that steals passwords, along with other account information, which then allows attackers to gain access to the company network and steal sensitive information.
            As our world has become increasingly reliant on technology and data stored online, data breaches have become a an omnipresent threat to users, businesses, government agencies, bank, hospitals and go on. The effects brought on by a data breach can come in a big damage.Victims and their customers may also suffer financial and reputation losses. Due to the limited risk of prosecution, the profitability of data theft will continue to propel its prevalence.Therefore, security and prevention is always better than dealing with the consequences of a data breach. So, we must to use strong passwords, two-factor authentication, try not to give online services too much information about yourself. Our data has long been a valuable commodity and our task is to protect it as much as possible.`,
